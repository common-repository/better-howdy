Remove and restructure the 'Howdy' line by changing 'Howdy' to 'Logged in as'.

== Description ==

Remove and restructure the 'Howdy' line.  Props to Ozh for [No Howdy](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/no-howdy-a-plugin-for-wordpress/).

People have always seemed to complain about the 'Howdy' on the admin pages.  I personally don't care about the use of the word but think that the 'Howdy area' could be more functional and user friendly.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `better-howdy` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Usage ==

1. Just activate and enjoy!  No configuration required.
